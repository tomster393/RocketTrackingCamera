# RocketTrackingCamera
This code requires two pieces of information:
1. altitude data (this can be exported from an open rocket simulation)
2. the distance from the camera to the pad

You can use this website https://onlinetexttools.com/add-text-suffix to add the comma to the end of each data point and then insert that into the code.
